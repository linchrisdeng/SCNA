# Scientific Computing & Numerical Analysis (SCNA)
 
```{tip}
 ** The entire core of Scientific Computing & Numerical Analysis (SCNA) can be said to be the study of how to make computers compute systems of linear/non-linear equations ** 
```

Welcome to SCNA. This is a website for Lin Deng to store the notes and application of scientific computation methods during his PhD journey. The repo launched from Dec 2021 when Lin finished his first-year confirmation meeting at the U of Melbourne (Melbourne Business School). Aimed at consolidating the understanding of scientific computation techniques and rebuild the notion of coordinate changing in the computational research work, the notes contain 3 aspects to illustrate SCNA in Finance, Econ. Part 1: Algebra with Matrix, Linear System and Factor Analysis, Part 2: Numeric Optimization, Part 3: Nonlinear/Dynamic System - Differential Equations.

The material is mainly referenced to the book DDMSC[^1] and Project LAFF[^2]. Contents are split into the following sections:
